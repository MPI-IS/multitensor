## Dependencies:
Boost Graph Library: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_62_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html

## What's included:
- `MultiTensor.cpp` : General version of the algorithm. Considers directed and weigthed multilayer networks with any community structures (non-diagonal or restricted diagonal affinity matrices W).

Use the version that most resembles your network, i.e. if you have an undirected network use `MultiTensor_undirected.cpp`. If you also know that the partition is assortative then use the flag '-A 1'.

## Requirements:
Need to make a directory called `data` outside the folder where the `.cpp`  and `Makefile` are stored. Just type from the command line, inside that folder: 
* `mkdir data`

## How to compile the code:
Multitensor should first be complied modifing appropriately the Makefile included.
You need to specify the file to be compiled by assigning BIN. Example: if you want to compile MultiTensor.cpp then assign BIN=MultiTensor .
LIBS and LIBS should point to the directories where you installed boost. You can also arbitrarily modify the compiler's flags under CXXFLAGS.
Check the boost version you have installed and modify the LIBS flag accordingly. Default uses boost 1.58.0.

Then just type from the command line:

`make`

## How to run run the code:
Type in the command line the name of the binary file (the same you used assigned to BIN) + all the command line options you want to use. Example:

`./MultiTensor -k 2 -l 3 -a "adjacency.dat" -E "_endfile.dat" `

You can test the code by typing on a shell inside this folder:
`./MultiTensor`
This will use the `../data/adjacency.dat` file as input and L=4, K=5 as default.

### Required arguments

- `-a` : Adjacency matrix file
- `-f` : Folder where the adjacency input and output are/will be stored (inside `data` folder).

### Optional arguments

- `-E` : Output end of file where the paramters' files will be stored. Example: `-E="_abc.dat" ` output files will be `u_K4_abc.dat`,`v_K4_abc.dat`,`w_K4_abc.dat` (assuming that k=4). Default value is `-E=".dat"`.
- `-i` : Initialization flag: if `i=0` than parametrs are randomly initialized; if `i=1` the membership vectors u and v and w are initialized form file; if `i=2` only w is initialized from file; if `i=3` only u and v are initialized from file, w instead is random.

* `-w` : End of the file where the parameters can be initialized from, in case initialization variable is greater than 0.

* `-l` : Number of layers, default is 1.

* `-k` : Number of communities, default is 4.
* `-r` : Number of different realizations, the final parameters will be the one correspondinf to the realization leading to the max likelihood. Default is 1.
* `-t` : Max iteration time. Default is 500.
* `-e` : Convergence tolerance. Default is 0.1 .
* `-y` : Decision variable for convergence. Default is 10.
* `-z` : Seed for random real numbers.
* `-s` : Seed for random integer numbers.
* `-A` : Flag to call the (faster) restricted assortative version (purely diagonal affinity matrix).

## Input format.
The multilayer adjacency matrix should be formatted as an edge list with L+3 columns:

`E node1 node2 3 0 0 1`

The first columns tells the algorithm that the row denotes an edge; the second and third are the source and target nodes of that edge, respectively; l+3 column tells if there is that edge in the l-th layer and the weigth (must be integer). In this example the edge node1 --> node2 exists in layer 1 with weight 3 and in layer 4 with weight 1, but not in layer 2 and 3.

## Output.
Three files will be generated: the two NxK membership matrices `U` and `V`, and the KxK layer affinity matrix `W`. Supposing that K=4 and `E=".dat"` the output files will be inside `data` folder with names:
- `u_K4.dat`
- `v_K4.dat`
- `w_K4.dat`

The first line outputs the Max Likelihood among the realizations.
For the membership files, the subsequent lines contain L+1 columns: the first one is the node label, the follwing ones are the (not normalized) membership vectors' entries.
For the affinity matrix file, the subsequent lines start with the number of the layer and then the matrix for that layer.
For the restricted assortative version only the diagonal entries of the affinity matrix are printed. The first entry of each row is the layer index.
